# Below setting work in Mac, CentOS - Tested! 
# If you have yubi key in your environment, it will jsut cache the entry.
# You can limit the persist caching by "ControlPersist 10m" 

# SSH multiplexing is the ability to carry multiple SSH sessions over a 
# single TCP connection.

# The ControlPath entry specifies where to store the “control socket” for 
# the multiplexed connections. In this case, %r refers to the remote login name, 
# %h refers to the target host name, and %p refers to the destination port. 
# Including this information in the control socket name helps SSH separate 
# control sockets for connections to different hosts.

# The ControlMaster setting is what activates multiplexing. With the auto 
# setting, SSH will try to use a master connection if one exists, but if 
# one doesn’t exist it will create a new one (this is probably the most 
# flexible approach, but you can refer to ssh-config(5) for more details 
# on the other settings).

# Finally, the ControlPersist setting keeps the master connection alive for 
# the specified period of time after it has remained idle (no connections). 
# After that time, the master connection will be closed. In this example, 
# we’ve specified that the master connection should remain open for 10 minutes 
# after becoming idle. Subsequent SSH sessions made while the master connection 
# is open will leverage the master connection and will reset the idle timer.

# You just need to add below in your ${HOME}/.ssh/config
# If file doesnt exists then create it
